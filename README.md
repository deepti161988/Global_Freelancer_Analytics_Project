# Global_Freelancer_Analytics_Project
Global Freelancer Analytics Project uses Python, Power Query, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and model global freelancer data. It includes EDA, DAX measures, segmentation logic, and interactive insights to explore freelancer performance, skills, rates, and market trends.

This end-to-end analytics project transforms raw global freelancer data into actionable insights using Python, Power Query, and Power BI. After cleaning and standardizing the dataset, an interactive report uncovers patterns in earnings, skills, ratings, and experience across countries. Users can explore KPIs, segment freelancers, compare markets, and view detailed drillthrough profiles supported by custom DAX logic. The repository includes the raw and cleaned datasets, Python EDA notebook, Power BI file, and full project documentation—making it a complete, portfolio-ready case study in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
